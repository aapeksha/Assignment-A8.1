# Assignment-A8.1
Time Complexity for finding weather a number is prime or not is O(sqrt n) because the loop runs from 2 to sqrt(n).
Space Complexity for finding weather a number is prime or not is O(1) since we are not using any extra space.

If there are N numbers in a range
Time Complexity is N*O(sqrt n).
Space Complexity is N*O(1).
